# Data Structures Problems (YouTube Tutorials)

This repository contains solutions and explanations for common **data structures** problems that were explained in detail on the YouTube channel. The problems include implementations of:

- **Single Linked List**
- **Double Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**

Each of these data structures has been implemented and explained in a way that helps learners understand the underlying concepts and operations. Below is a brief overview of each data structure and its key operations.

## 1. **Single Linked List**
   A **single linked list** is a linear data structure where each element is a node that contains two parts: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. 

   Key operations:
   - **Insert at beginning**
   - **Insert at end**
   - **Insert at position**
   - **Delete node**
   - **Traverse list**

## 2. **Double Linked List**
   A **double linked list** is similar to a single linked list, but each node contains a reference to both the next node and the previous node. This allows for traversal in both directions.

   Key operations:
   - **Insert at beginning**
   - **Insert at end**
   - **Insert at position**
   - **Delete node**
   - **Traverse list**

## 3. **Stack**
   A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In First Out)** principle. Elements are inserted and removed from the same end (top of the stack).

   Key operations:
   - **Push** (add an element to the stack)
   - **Pop** (remove the top element)
   - **Peek** (get the top element without removing it)
   - **IsEmpty** (check if the stack is empty)

## 4. **Queue**
   A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First In First Out)** principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

   Key operations:
   - **Enqueue** (add an element to the rear)
   - **Dequeue** (remove an element from the front)
   - **Peek** (get the front element without removing it)
   - **IsEmpty** (check if the queue is empty)
